# README Maker

## The Goal

Create a program using node.js and npm that generates a new Readme file based on user input.

## What I've Done

Followed directions to the best of my ability. Generator creates all required sections.

Licenses are selected from a list, then the appropriate information is applied.


## Usage

initiate with

node index.js

then simply follow the prompts! Your new readme's filename will be newREADME.md, and will be in the root of the readme-maker folder.
